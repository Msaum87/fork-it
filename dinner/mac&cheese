  35g cheddar (or other cheese of choice)
}

  2 portions of noodles of choice (macaroni being the obvious)

## Steps
Step 1{
  Place your cauliflower on one cookie sheet
  Mix your other veggies with the oil and place them on the other cookie sheet
  Place in the oven at 200C for 20 minutes
}
Step 2{
  Cook the onion, mushroom, and butter in your large pot on a medium-high heat
  When onions are tender and mushrooms are cooked, pour out onto a bowl or plate, giving you the empty pot again
}
Step 3{
  Cook the ham blocks in the medium skillet on a separate stovetop burner on medium-high heat
  Set aside when starting the edges start turning brown
}
Step 4{
  Melt the butter in your large pot. Don't worr about the liquid or small piece of onion leftover
  Once butter is fully melted, mix in flour in stages. This will turn into an almost dough-like mixture
  Pour in milk in batches of about 50ml. Mix thourougly until same consistency throughout, then add more milk (do this until desired consistency)
  Add garlic, spices, salt, and pepper
  Add cheese. Mix until cheese starts melting a bit.

  Add the roasted cauliflower into the pot with your sauce. Using an immersion blender, mix until no large pieces are left
  Return the onion/mushroom mixture to the pot
  Add the ham
  Add the roasted vegetables
