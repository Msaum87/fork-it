## Kitchen Requirements
1 stovetop
1 oven @ 200C
1 large pot with lid
1 cookie sheet / roasting pan

## Ingredients
Step 1{
  10g butter
  2 chicken breasts, chopped (or dark meat for stronger flavor)
  2 cloves garlic, minced
  
}
Step 2{
  200g oven-roastable vegetables, chopped (100g broccoli, 50g carrot, 50g celery)
  1 tsp oil
}

  65g butter
  65g flour
  1 bullion cube of choice (vegetable is my choice)
  750ml water
}
Optional: 
Step 4{
  100g cheddar
}

## Instructions
Step 1{
  Throw the butter and the chicken into the pot, cook on a medium heat with lid, stirring every few minutes. 
  Cook like this for about 15 minutes, add the garlic around 10 minutes
  Remove and set in bowl or plate when done, we need our pot later
}

Step 2{
  Mix oil over chopped veggies, put on cookie sheet and cook in oven at 200C for 20 minutes
}

Step 3{
  Melt butter
  Mix flour in small batches until consistent throughout each time
  Add boullion cube, mash it up into the mixture
  Mix in water in small batches, until consistent throughout each time
}

Step 4{
  Add chicken and roasted veggies to the pot. Add cheddar if desired. 
  Stir and mix, leaving to cook on a low-medium heat. If you stir and feel things sticking to the bottom, your heat is a bit too high
  Cook like this for about 10 minutes to bring flavor together

We like to eat this in a breadbowl, but noodles are also an option if desired.
