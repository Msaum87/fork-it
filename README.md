# Info before beginning

## General tips:
- Consistency is key. When adding/mixing/stirring anything, always do so until the item is the same consitency all the way through.
- Better to have a lower stovetop heat and take more time, than too high a heat and burn to your pan
- Change and adjust to your own preferences. Gods above know that all I did was steal these recipes and adjust them

## Commonly used terms in these recipes:

### Default Ingredients:
- oil = sunflower oil
- butter = unsalted grass-fed butter. Non-grassfed butter tends to be too firm for some applications. And we always add our own salt

### We have an induction stovetop with numbers 1-9
- low heat = 2
- medium heat = 4
- medium-high heat = 6
- high heat = 8


### In terms of ingredient preparation:
- minced = nothing bigger than 2mm (usually garlic prep)
- diced = nothing biger than 10mm (onion pieces in a soup)
- chopped = nothing bigger than 2cm (carrot chunks you could eat with a fork)
