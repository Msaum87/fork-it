Crunchy Oat Cerial

## Kitchen Requirements
2 mixing bowls, medium-large
oven @ 200C
1 large cookie sheet/roasting pan
1 large storage container for cereal


## Notes
The ingredients between Step 1 and Step 2 can vary. For example, if you have raw nuts, you want to include them in Step 1. If they're already roasted, then put them in Step 2
To simplify this, I tend to buy raw nuts, but already dried/baked fruits.

## Ingredients
Step 1{
  300g Oat Flakes (check your natural foods section)
  1 tbsp cinnamon
  30g nuts, diced or chopped (I like to go half-half almond and hazelnut. Macadameia is also great)
  125ml maple syrup
  125ml oil
  .5 tsp vanilla (1 capful usually)
}

Step 2{
  150g dried fruit (use your preference for this. Some examples we have done are:
                        - 75g raisin, 75g apple chips
                        - 75g raisin, 75g dried cranberries
                        - 50g dried mango diced pieces, 100g banana chips, broken up into smaller pieces )
}

## Instructions
Step 1{
  Spread the mixture over the cookie sheet evenly, it may be a bit thick, but an evenly spread layer is key
  Cook in oven for 24 minutes. Every 6 minutes, pull out of oven and stir around. Make an even layer again, return to oven.
  After 24 minutes, take out of oven, stir one last time, and set to cool for 10 minutes or so
}

Step 2{
  Mix the not-oven-hot mixture from Step 1 into the bowl with the fruits from Step 2
  Stir thoroughly. Store in cereal container
