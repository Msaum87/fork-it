Making this with 2x ingredients feeds our family of 3 with no leftovers.
I use multiple skillets at once to speed up the cooking process.

## Kitchen Requirements
Mixer (not required but certainly helps)
Immersion blender/puree maker (again not required but helps)
Stovetop
Skillet

## Ingredients
Step 1{
  1 banana, mashed/pureed/blended
  1 egg
  200ml milk
}

Step 2{
  1tsp baking powder
  1 tsp cinnamon
  125g flour
}

Step 3{
  2g butter
}

## Instructions
Step 1{
  Mix the banana, egg, and milk until it is a foamy fluffed up mixture
}

Step 2{
  Mix these 3 drygoods together and then pour them into your banana mixture, 1/3 at a time, mixing completely each time
}

Step 3{
  Wipe butter over the skillet with a paper towel or spatula. Heat skillet on medium-high heat before adding mixture
  Pour 1 ladel full (~230ml from mine) onto already heated skillet.
  Cook one side until the top looks a bit "dried up" and not like liquid batter. ~5 minutes on my stove
  Flip, cook other side for ~ 5 minutes.

Enjoy with powdered sugar, maple syrup, or plain.
